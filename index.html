        <p class="hometext row">
          Embracing the integral roles the urban forest plays in our environment, society, culture, and economy, the City of Peterborough is dedicated to preserving, renewing, and enhancing this invaluable resource. <span class="emphasis">Our goal is clear â€“ to increase our tree canopy coverage to 35% by 2051.</span></p> 
        <p class="hometext row">
          This initiative acknowledges the numerous benefits our trees provide and solidifies our commitment to community stewardship and strategic urban forest management. Leveraging GIS technology, we've partnered with Canopy Core Solutions to <span class="emphasis">identify Potential Planting Areas (PPA)</span> within the city. This crucial step aids us in outlining our strategic approach to urban forest expansion.

        <h6 class="h6text">Precision in Assessing Tree Canopy: The Key to Strategic Urban Forest Growth Planning</h6>
        <p class="hometext row">
          Capitalizing on <span class="emphasis">LiDAR</span> technology, we've accurately assessed the <span class="emphasis">City of Peterborough's tree canopy coverage</span>, with a specific focus on vegetation that is 5m or taller. Our comprehensive process involved extracting a canopy height model from the LiDAR data and transforming this into a polygon layer, using a <span class="emphasis">technique that preserved the true shape of each canopy.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="hometext row">
          This allowed us to smooth over-pixelated gaps while preserving the dimensions, structure, and patterns of the <span class="emphasis">Canopy Height Model (CHM)</span>. We further enhanced reliability by cross-validating this data with high-resolution aerial imagery. To enrich our final LiDAR-derived canopy layer, we <span class="emphasis">integrated existing tree inventory data</span>, creating a comprehensive canopy analysis.

        <h6 class="h6text">Identifying Potential Planting Spaces: A GIS-Driven Approach to Uncover Suitable Tree Growth Areas</h6>
        <p class="hometext row">
          To identify potential planting areas within the City of Peterborough, our team conducted a thorough <span class="emphasis">Spatial Analysis</span>. Initially, we focused on extracting pervious surfaces from a comprehensive land classification. These surfaces encompass areas with <span class="emphasis">suitable soil and non-canopy</span> land cover types that have the potential for tree planting. The identified areas were further processed with buffer layers, taking into consideration specific criteria supplied by the City.
        </p>
        <p class="hometext row">
          Additionally, we employed a <span class="emphasis">'Fishnet' grid technique</span> to precisely identify even the smallest areas, measuring <span class="emphasis">at least 15 square meters</span>, suitable for tree planting.
          To enhance our analysis and provide valuable insights, we integrated this data with layers depicting <span class="emphasis">land ownership, ward boundaries, and zoning regulations</span>. This comprehensive process yielded a reliable map showcasing potential planting spaces, marking significant progress toward the expansion of Peterborough's urban forest.
        </p>
        <p class="hometext row">
          Subsequently, we prioritized these potential planting areas using a <span class="emphasis">multi-criteria decision analysis technique and overlay analysis</span>. This methodology ensured a balanced consideration of various factors, including <span class="emphasis">social equity, heat island locations, existing canopy cover percentage, and areas with the highest potential</span> for achieving optimal canopy coverage.

        <h6 class="h6text">Tree Planting Timeline</h6>
        <p class="hometext row">
          Based on our most recent estimate from 2022 LiDAR data, the <span class="emphasis">City of Peterborough has 29% canopy cover.</span> Once we determined where trees could be planted in the city, this gave us an overall area of potential planting areas (PPAs) on city-owned and private properties. 
        </p>
        <p class="hometext row">
          Based on these values, canopy spread, and various tree-planting densities, we were able to provide an estimate of the number of trees required to <span class="emphasis">fill all potential planting areas in the city by 2051</span>. 
          Over the next twenty-eight years, the city needs to <span class="emphasis">plant 1,181 trees/year</span>, while PPAs on privately-owned lands should be planted at a rate of <span class="emphasis">5,765 trees/year</span>. With all PPAs filled, the maximum achievable canopy by 2051 according to our estimates, is <span class="emphasis">34%</span>.
